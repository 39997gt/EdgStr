# EdgeFy
EdgeFy is a software refactoring infrastructure that automatically transforms a two-tier distributed application into its three-tier variant. EdgeFy employs powerful profiling as well as code transformation and generation techniques to preserve the original execution semantics, adaptively reduce response latency, and increase processing throughput. It also introduces replicated state, efficiently synchronized across the edge and the cloud layers by
means of Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT).

## Requirements
This codebase was mainly developed with:
- node 12.6.0
- Python 2.7
- [jalangi2](https://github.com/Samsung/jalangi2)
- [z3py](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
- [goreplay](https://github.com/buger/goreplay)
- [CRDT Data Structure](https://github.com/automerge/automerge)  

## Installing Node.js-dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Installing python-dependencies
```bash
npm run installing-py
```


# How to run EdgeFy?

To determine the Subject S, EdgeFy starts from instrumenting all HTTP traffic or [its records](https://github.com/39997gt/EdgeFy/blob/master/rec_HTTPs/realty_rec_req_res.gor) between Client and the Real Subject (or the Node.js Cloud app). EdgeFy decodes the parameters of the client’s HTTP requests p<sub>1</sub>,..., p<sub>N</sub> and the return results of the server’s HTTP responses r<sub>1</sub>,..., r<sub>N</sub> and makes a Subject inteface.

- To generate an Edge Replica, EdgeFy dynamically analyzes a cloud/client-based app.
Originally the server program was running,  
```
node subject_apps/ionic2-realty-rest/server.js
```
- Now the cloud server program is profiled as below.
```bash
RECORD=rec_HTTPs/realty_rec_req_res.gor SERVER=subject_apps/ionic2-realty-rest/server.js npm run EdgeRefactoring 
```
- EdgeFy extracts the [Subject.json](https://github.com/39997gt/EdgeFy/blob/master/Subject.json) and then starts the instrumentation.
- EdgeFy's execution traces include:
  - 1) Datalog facts: RW-Log(s<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>1</sub>), RW-Log-Fuzzed(s<sub>1</sub>,1,p<sub>1</sub>), RW-Log-Fuzzed(s<sub>1</sub>,2,p<sub>1</sub>),...
  - 2) Snapshot(Automerge): database, files, and global variables.
- EdgeFy represents the server program as Datalog facts and predicates. With the z3 engine, EdgeFy solves its constraints of the Subject for the server program not only to generate an Edge replica but also transform the original Cloud program.

- Briefly run a demo
  - Generated an execution trace script for realty-rest is located in [execution_traces/trace_realty.py](https://github.com/39997gt/EdgeFy/blob/master/execution_traces/trace_realty.py).
  - This z3py script will replicate required remote services of this benchmark for given the Subject. Then, EdgeFy generates Edge Replica and transforms original Cloud Program by using [templates](https://github.com/39997gt/EdgeFy/tree/master/src/templates).
    ```bash
    python execution_traces/trace_realty.py & node src/js/generator_edge_cloud.js
    ```  
  - 1) [Edge Replica](https://github.com/39997gt/EdgeFy/blob/master/results/edge/edge_replica.js)
  - 2) [Transformed Cloud Program](https://github.com/39997gt/EdgeFy/blob/master/results/cloud/server/enhanced_norm_property-service.js)
